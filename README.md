# Web Engineering 2022-2023 / Lab4 WebSockets

Please, go to the [GUIDE](docs/GUIDE.md) in order to get the instructions for this assignment.

Some ideas for obtaining a :gift: if you are the first that:

- **STOMP!**: Support STOMP in the server side and create a small client that uses it.
- **Sock from WebSocket**: Support SockJS in the server side and show that polling can be used as transport instead of WebSocket when needed ([additional info](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/reference/html/web.html#websocket-fallback-sockjs-client)).
- **Turn sides**: Turn the DOCTOR into a client of the server, so, the server acts only as message broker.
- **Relay**: Use the server as a relay server to connect to an external message broker (e.g. RabbitMQ, [additional info](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/reference/html/web.html#websocket-stomp-handle-broker-relay))

Note: unless the goal specifies o disallows a specific framework you are free to replace the framework used in the original implementation with a different framework.

Manifest your intention first by a PR updating this `README.md` with your goal.
If you desist of your goal, release it by a PR so other fellow can try it.
